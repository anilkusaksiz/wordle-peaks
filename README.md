## Develop

Pull requests and issues are welcome, but please create an issue or contact me before putting a lot of work into something I may not want to merge!

2. Write code
3. `npm run format`

## Translate

If you can contribute a translation, please check out [this link](https://crowdin.com/project/wordle-peaks), or create a pull request with a translated copy of [this file](https://github.com/vegeta897/wordle-peaks/blob/main/src/lib/translations/en/main.json) in a new locale folder (e.g. `de/main.json`).

Or if you don't want to do any of that, you can just get in touch with me and send the translation in whatever way is convenient for you.

The word list for the game itself will remain in English. If you want to play with a different dictionary, please create a fork.
